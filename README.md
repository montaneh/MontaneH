👋 Hi, I'm a multi-talented personality，so called "slash girl[斜杠青年]" in China, with muti-hobbies in the HCI, AI tech, yoga, writing, reading, and dancing communities. 

As a Co-founder, AI-Tech Geeker and AI Product Specialist, I co-founded a start-up "[1024AI](https://1024ai.com/)" with other geekers, which is aiming to help youth to have a promising career. Welcome new friends and invite more geekers to join us!

As a 7-year Yogi, I initiated "SomaFlow" Yoga. I love to share my knowledge and experience through articles and videos, and 1.5k+ fans from all social media have followed me. 

As an amateur writer, I have written hundreds of articles on documentary prose, AI product opinions, and book recommendations, which I have almost published in my online blog in China. Two articles have been selected to be published in a famous newspaper journal named "[Guangming Daily](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guangming_Daily)" in China.

As a HCI researcher, my paper won the ## Best Paper Award ## on "[Asian CHI](https://www.asianchi.net/)", which named “[Beyond Fitness: Exploring Yoga Mental Aspects as an Interaction Strategy for Self-practice Yogi](https://montanehwang.notion.site/beyond-fitness-exploring-yoga-mental-aspects?pvs=4)”!

As a Podcast producer, I am making a podast named "MX Hackers[MX骇客志]" in China so far with an AI algorithm wizard who is my old friend.

I worked in the AI industry for 6+ years. I was a respected team leader and product manager in predominant AI companies, having led, organized, and mentored numerous AI product designs and businesses.  
Years ago, I quit my promising job to pursue academic knowledge in HCI technology in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Copenhagen. My main interests are all related to Brain-Computer Interactions, specifically in Affective Interaction, Human Brain/Body Interface, Fabrication, Shape-Changing Interface, Sensing \& Computing, XR/Human AI Interaction, Body-centered Design, and Wearables.
