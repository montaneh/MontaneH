ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm a multi-talented personality with muti-hobbies in the HCI, AI tech, yoga, writing, reading, and dancing communities. 

I worked in the AI industry for 6+ years. I was a respected team leader and product manager in predominant AI companies, having led, organized, and mentored numerous AI product designs and businesses. Three years ago, I quit my promising job to pursue an academic career in HCI. I am an HCI researcher in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Copenhagen. My main interests are all related to Body/Brain interactions, specifically in Affective Interaction, Human Brain/Body Interface, Fabrication, Shape-Changing Interface, Sensing \& Computing, XR/Human AI Interaction, Body-centered Design, and Wearables.

As a 7-year Yogi and 6-year AI Product Specialist, I love to share my knowledge and experience through articles and videos, and 1.5k+ fans from all social media have followed me. 

As an amateur writer, I have written hundreds of articles on documentary prose, AI product opinions, and book recommendations, which I have almost published in my online blog in China. Two articles have been selected to be published in a famous newspaper journal named "[Guangming Daily](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guangming_Daily)" in China.

As an AI-Tech pioneer, I co-founded a start-up "[1024AI](https://1024ai.com/)" with other geekers, which is aiming to help youth to have a promising career. Welcome new friends and invite more geekers to join us!
