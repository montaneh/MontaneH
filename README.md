👋 Hi, I'm a multi-talented personality with muti-hobbies in the HCI, tech, yoga, writing, reading, and dancing communities. 

I worked in the AI industry for 6 years(until 2022). I was a respected team leader and product manager in AI companies, having led, organized, and mentored numerous AI product designs and business. Since 2022, I quit my promising job to pursue an academic career in HCI. I am an HCI research beginner and MSc student in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Copenhagen. My main interests are in AR/XR/Human AI Interaction/AIforSocialScience/self-representation design/wearables/fabrication/interaction design/data visualization/ubiquitous computing.

As a 5-year Yogi, I love to share my knowledge and experience through articles and videos, and 1k+ fans from multiple social media have followed me. As an amateur writer, I have written hundreds of articles on documentary proses, AI product opinions, and book recommendations, almost published in my online blog in China. One article has been selected to be published in a famous newspaper journal（in China） named "Guang Ming Daily."
